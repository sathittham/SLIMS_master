 * alternative to the UI hogging View class. We want to render outside of the UI
 * thread, which is what SurfaceView is for. However, SurfaceView has
 * significant drawbacks. TextView is essentially the same as the SurfaceView,
 * but it behaves as a normal view and supports normal view operations. TextView
 * requires hardware acceleration and, because it is more flexible than
 * SurfaceView, incurs a performance hit. You would not want to use it for

	 * Developer Note: In the interest of keeping everything as fast as
	 * possible, only the measurements are redrawn, the gauge background and
	 * display information are drawn once per device orientation and then cached
	 * so they can be reused. All allocation and reclaiming of memory should
	 * occur before and after the handler is posted to the thread, but never
	 * while the thread is running. Allocation and reclamation of memory while
	 * the handler is posted to the thread will cause the GC to run, resulting
	 * in long delays (up to 600ms) while the GC cleans up memory. The frame
	 * rate to drop dramatically if the GC is running often, so try to keep it
	 * happy and out of the way.

	 */

	/*
	 * Developer Note: There are some things to keep in mind when it comes to
	 * Android and hardware acceleration. What we see in Android 4.0 is “full”
	 * hardware acceleration. All UI elements in windows, and third-party apps
	 * will have access to the GPU for rendering. Android 3.0 had the same
	 * system, but now developers will be able to specifically target Android
	 * 4.0 with hardware acceleration. Google is encouraging developers to
	 * update apps to be fully-compatible with this system by adding the
	 * hardware acceleration tag in an app’s manifest. Android has always used
	 * some hardware accelerated drawing.
	 * 
	 * Since before 1.0 all window compositing to the display has been done with
	 * hardware. "Full" hardware accelerated drawing within a window was added
	 * in Android 3.0. The implementation in Android 4.0 is not any more full
	 * than in 3.0. Starting with 3.0, if you set the flag in your app saying
	 * that hardware accelerated drawing is allowed, then all drawing to the
	 * application’s windows will be done with the GPU. The main change in this
	 * regard in Android 4.0 is that now apps that are explicitly targeting 4.0
	 * or higher will have acceleration enabled by default rather than having to
	 * put android:handwareAccelerated="true" in their manifest. (And the reason
	 * this isn’t just turned on for all existing applications is that some
	 * types of drawing operations can’t be supported well in hardware and it
	 * also impacts the behavior when an application asks to have a part of its
	 * UI updated. Forcing hardware accelerated drawing upon existing apps will
	 * break a significant number of them, from subtly to significantly.)
